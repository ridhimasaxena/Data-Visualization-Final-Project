# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the cdc dataset that I have been analyzing for the past few weeks. I believe that there are interesting attributes in the dataset as well as many data points (10,000), which could lend to lots of potential for various visualizations.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatterplot and it shows age (in years) on the x-axis and weight (in lbs) on the y-axis.

Another visualization is a scatterplot showing whether a person exercises or not (0 or 1) on the x-axis and what their weight is on the y-axis.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) Which variable out of all the variables in the dataset is the strongest indicator of general health?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
