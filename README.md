# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the cdc dataset that I have been analyzing for the past few weeks. I believe that there are interesting attributes in the dataset as well as many data points (10,000), which could lend to lots of potential for various visualizations.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatterplot and it shows age (in years) on the x-axis and weight (in lbs) on the y-axis.

Another visualization is a scatterplot showing whether a person exercises or not (0 or 1) on the x-axis and what their weight is on the y-axis.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which variable out of all the variables in the dataset is the strongest indicator of general health?
 * What are the thresholds to categorize health as very good vs. excellent etc.?
 * How does the general health compare for males vs. females?
 * How does the smoking compare for males vs. females?

## Sketches

The sketches above show the distribution of the dataset and the classifications of their general health status. The data is visualized in a pie chart. The next sketch compares general health between males and females in a bar chart. This satisfies the third question of how general health compares for males vs. females. Similarly the third sketch outlines smoking status between males and females. 


## Open Questions

I am still working on how to visualize the strongest variable to detect general health and how to categorize general health based on that variable. I think potentially using a regression model and then visualizing what that variable looks like would be useful.
